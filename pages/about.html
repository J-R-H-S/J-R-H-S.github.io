paused puppy program, left best male intact. purchased female that contains 4 of our bloodlines. puppies from california to maine. Repeat customers. Never ship puppies, too traumatic, but will meet halfway or deliver. 4 pupppies available, 14 weeks old. 3 males and female. We have four generations of genetics under our belt and we encourage prospective puppy parents to meet our curent adults. We focus on exposure to livestock, fowl, goats, perimeter monitoring. We teach our puppies to follow a fence-line until they find a gate. They have been taught good food manners and been raised around children. Great thing about great pyrenees is that you can trust them with your family, livestock, and can still recognize a predator that needs to be eliminated. They are both gentle protectors and gladiators. We are always available to customers if there are questions or concerns. In our x years of breeding, we have only had two puppies returned and due to no fault. Both puppies were found suitable replacement homes and integrated meeting all expectations. Our dogs are not AKC Registered, however, we have done genetic testing and stand behind their DNA.
